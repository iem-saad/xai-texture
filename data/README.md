# Dataset Description

## Preprocessed Dataset
The CBIS-DDSM dataset has been preprocessed to create a cropped version based on the region of interest (ROI) of the mask area. This preprocessing step resulted in the creation of the `CBIS-DDSM-Patches` folder, which contains both training and test sets. Each set includes cancer images along with their corresponding masks.

## Texture Features
Additionally, the `CBIS-DDSM-TEM-Features` folder contains nine subfolders labeled `Feature_1` through `Feature_9`. These features were extracted using Laws texture energy masks and include the following textures:

1. L5E5 / E5L5
2. L5S5 / S5L5
3. L5R5 / R5L5
4. E5S5 / S5E5
5. E5R5 / R5E5
6. R5S5 / S5R5
7. S5S5
8. E5E5
9. R5R5
