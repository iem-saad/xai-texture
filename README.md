# Explainability in Deep Learning Segmentation Models for Breast Cancer by Analogy with Texture Analysis

This repository hosts the source code and related materials for the paper titled "Explainability in Deep Learning Segmentation Models for Breast Cancer by Analogy with Texture Analysis". Our project aims to advance the explainability of deep learning models in medical imaging, specifically in the context of breast cancer segmentation. By drawing analogies with texture analysis, we propose a novel approach to interpret the model's decisions, making these models more transparent and trustworthy for medical practitioners.
